# AUTO-HEADER

This is an utility I created for myself and published for anyone that
may be interested in using it.

This program helps you to create headers for your source code files, to
add a copyright note, filename, function of the file, project, date...

This is done from a template and can be configured in detail, you just
run the program in a directory.
